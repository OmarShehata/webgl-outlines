# ThreeJS minimal outlines example

This is a minimal implementation of the v2 outlines technique without any debug code. Use this version when copying this effect into your project or building on top of it. 

See [Better outline rendering using surface IDs with WebGL](https://omar-shehata.medium.com/better-outline-rendering-using-surface-ids-with-webgl-e13cdab1fd94) for an explanation of how this technique works.

To run this locally, run `npm install` and `npm run dev` in this directory.
